# Space-Game
Team Project from Camp Lejeune MSSA Cohort 7

This space game project was created by myself and a team of 4 other developers in the second month of class.

The game is a console app that features mining in the asteroid belt, travelling to 5 different planets to trade goods, ship ugrades, and combat.
